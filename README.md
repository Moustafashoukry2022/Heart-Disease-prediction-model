Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various features like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, BMI, and other health-related attributes.

Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model using a dataset that contains various health-related features. After training a machine learning model (such as RandomForestClassifier or other classifiers), the model can be used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on new input data.

Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing:
The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features.
Numerical features: These include attributes such as Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, etc.
Categorical features: These include attributes such as Exercise Habits, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, and others.
One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features to convert them into a format that can be used by machine learning models.

Standardization: Numerical features were scaled to bring them to a similar scale, using StandardScaler to ensure that no feature dominates over others in the model.

2. Model Training:
We trained a machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost) on the preprocessed data.
The training process involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
3. Prediction:
After the model is trained, it can be used to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on new input data.
The input data must have the same structure (same columns in the same order) as the training data.
We applied a pipeline to preprocess the new input data before making predictions.
4. Handling Feature Name Mismatch:
One of the key challenges was ensuring that the input data for prediction matches the exact column names and order used during training.
To avoid warnings about feature name mismatches, we ensured that the input data columns are ordered correctly before making predictions.
5. Suppressing Warnings:
To avoid any warnings related to feature mismatches during the prediction phase, we used warnings.filterwarnings("ignore").
6. Making Predictions:
After ensuring the input data format is correct, the trained model was used to predict whether the new data corresponds to heart disease (1) or no heart disease (0).
Project Files
Prediction Model:

The main model code is in a Jupyter notebook (or Python script) where we handle data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions.
Input Data:

New input data must be provided in the same format as the original training data (numerical values for continuous features, one-hot encoded values for categorical features).
Required Libraries:

pandas: For handling dataframes and data manipulation.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and preprocessing tools like StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, etc.
warnings: For suppressing warnings (optional).
xgboost or randomforest: For training the machine learning model.
